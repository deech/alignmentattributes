#+TITLE: Readme

* Getting started
First clone this repo and `c2hs` into the same directory, for example:
#+begin_example
> mkdir c2hstest
> cd c2hstest
> git clone https://github.com/deech/alignattributes
> git clone https://github.com/haskell/c2hs
#+end_example

Then run the test suite:
#+begin_example
> cd alignattributes
> cabal test
#+end_example

And that's it! More docs will follow as needed but that should get you started ...
